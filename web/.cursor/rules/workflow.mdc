## Development Workflow Guidelines

Follow these streamlined steps for new features and significant changes:

Research
	•	Identify current best practices and idiomatic patterns
	•	Prefer modern (recent) solutions over legacy

Balance
	•	Find the middle ground between originality and proven patterns
	•	Contextualize choices to the specific task

Recognize Limits
	•	Stop and revert if stuck on unsuccessful attempts
	•	Seek clarification when needed

Iterative Development Cycle
	1.	Ideate
	•	Consider multiple solutions; select a promising one
	•	Research existing implementations
	2.	Proliferate
	•	Implement chosen approach
	3.	Validate
	•	Test thoroughly
	•	If unsuccessful, ideate again or seek input
	4.	Simplify
	•	Remove unnecessary code and duplication
	•	Abstract common patterns
	5.	Document
	•	Maintain clear, concise documentation
	•	Write informative commit messages
	6.	Continue
	•	Move forward, applying lessons learned

These guidelines are flexible; adapt as needed.
