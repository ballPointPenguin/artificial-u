# Audio and Voice Components Refactoring Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. New Directory Structure

- Created `integrations/elevenlabs/` package for ElevenLabs-specific code
- Maintained `audio/` directory for speech processing and utilities
- Added new service classes for voice management and TTS

### 2. Component Separation

#### Integration Layer

- `integrations/elevenlabs/client.py` - Low-level API client
- `integrations/elevenlabs/voice_mapper.py` - Professor profile to voice matching
- `integrations/elevenlabs/cache.py` - Voice data caching system

#### Audio Layer

- `audio/speech_processor.py` - Text enhancement for better TTS
- `audio/audio_utils.py` - File and directory management for audio

#### Services Layer

- `services/voice_service.py` - High-level voice selection and management
- `services/tts_service.py` - Text-to-speech conversion
- `services/audio_service.py` - Updated to orchestrate the new components

### 3. Functionality Improvements

- Added discipline-specific text enhancements for different departments
- Improved voice selection algorithms with multiple fallback strategies
- Better caching system for voices with criteria-based lookup
- Improved handling of long text with more intelligent chunking

### 4. Integration with System

- Updated `system.py` to use the new components
- Ensured backward compatibility
- Made the audio component dependencies clearer

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Architecture**
   - Each component has a single, focused responsibility
   - Better adherence to separation of concerns
   - Improved testability of individual components

2. **Better Code Organization**
   - Clear layering: integrations → core components → services
   - Improved file organization matching functionality
   - Reduced code duplication

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Easier to extend with new voice providers
   - Adding new text enhancement rules is simpler
   - Configuration is more centralized

4. **Improved Performance**
   - Better caching for voice selection reduces API calls
   - More efficient handling of large chunks of text
   - Options for manual overrides and customization

## Next Steps

1. Add proper test coverage for all new components
2. Create a proper voice repository for persistent storage
3. Consider supporting additional TTS providers
4. Add more specialized text enhancement for academic disciplines
5. Implement metrics collection for TTS performance
