# Refactoring Summary

## Completed Changes

1. **Created Service Modules**
   - `services/professor_service.py` - Professor creation and management
   - `services/course_service.py` - Course and department management
   - `services/lecture_service.py` - Lecture generation and export
   - `services/audio_service.py` - Audio processing functionality

2. **Centralized Configuration**
   - Added `config/config_manager.py` to handle all configuration in one place
   - Replaced hardcoded defaults with configuration manager

3. **Simplified Main System Class**
   - Reduced `system.py` from ~1200 lines to ~200 lines
   - Changed from a monolithic class to an orchestration layer
   - Removed duplicate code and simplified error handling
   - Delegated specific functionality to appropriate service classes

4. **Improved Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns for better maintainability
   - Centralized dependencies and configuration
   - Better organization following Python best practices
   - Reduced code duplication

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**
   - Each service module is focused on a specific domain
   - Changes to one area won't affect others as much
   - Easier to understand each component's responsibility

2. **Testability**
   - Services can be tested independently
   - Simpler to mock dependencies for unit tests

3. **Extensibility**
   - New features can be added to specific services
   - New services can be added without changing existing ones

4. **Readability**
   - Code is organized by domain
   - Functions are grouped by responsibility
   - Main system class provides a clear API surface

## Next Steps

1. Update any client code that directly uses the system class
2. Add proper unit tests for each service
3. Consider adding type annotations for better IDE support
4. Review error handling for consistency across services
