# Refactoring Plan for system.py

## Current Issues

- `system.py` is extremely large (~45KB, 1200+ lines)
- It's a "God class" with too many responsibilities
- Tightly coupled functionality that's difficult to test
- Hard to maintain or extend

## Proposed Structure

### 1. Core System Module

`artificial_u/system.py` â†’ Simplified orchestration layer

- Thin orchestration layer that initializes and coordinates services
- Simple configuration management
- No direct business logic

### 2. Service Modules (New)

Create a services directory with dedicated modules:

`artificial_u/services/professor_service.py`

- Professor creation and management
- Professor voice assignment

`artificial_u/services/course_service.py`

- Course creation
- Course topics generation

`artificial_u/services/lecture_service.py`

- Lecture generation
- Lecture content management
- Lecture export

`artificial_u/services/audio_service.py`

- Audio generation functionality
- Voice processing

### 3. Utility Refinement

- Move helper methods to appropriate utility modules
- Clean up error handling
- Consolidate logging

### 4. Configuration Management

`artificial_u/config/config_manager.py`

- Centralized configuration management
- Environment variable handling

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the services directory structure
2. Extract each service, one at a time, ensuring tests pass
3. Update the main system class to use the new services
4. Clean up imports and dependencies
5. Update any client code
6. Remove redundant code

## Benefits

- Clearer separation of concerns
- Easier to test individual components
- More maintainable codebase
- Better organization following Python best practices
- Simpler onboarding for new developers
